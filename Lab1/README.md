# Lab1-Tableau Overview
This homework asked us to use Tableau to generate a series of visualizations for the article ‚ÄúThe Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood‚Äôs Exclusion of Women‚Äù https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ 

In this project, I:
* Used given dataset to replicate the three visualizations in the original article using Tableau
* Add two new visualizations that enhance the article. 

What I learned from this homework:
* Data clean and manipulation: import, sort, make calculated fields, create groups, etc.
* Organize sheet: differentiate measure and dimensions, create simple visualization and change chart type, adjust encodings, adjust aggregation methods (e.g. sum, average, count), sort axis, etc.
* Build dashboard and stories
* Action: create annotations on the chart, create data filters, link sheets together with actions, add analytics enhancements (e.g., constant line, regression), edit legend and filter by legend, etc.

My visualization works from this homework:
Please check out the only pdf file inside this folder. Other than the first image, I generated all the five visualizations.

# Introduction to the Files
There are a total of 3 files I worked on for this homework. These files are:
*  `lab1.twb`
*  `lab1_individual.twbx`
*  `The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood‚Äôs Exclusion of Women.pdf`

Of those 3 files, `lab1_individual.twbx` is the main file you should open through Tableau.
