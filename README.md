# Lab1-Tableau Overview
It is a program to use data to validate an opinion "The Makeup Industry Is Now More Skin Shade–Inclusive Than Ever." I chose 
the data of historical shades set evolution of Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, for both its largest color variations in current mainstream foundations and its constant name convention (otherwise, I am not able to scrape its previous color set on the webpage). 

In this project, I:
* Download the individual dataset from Canvas
* Replicate the three visualizations in the original article using Tableau (work to get these as close in look and feel as you can… fonts, colors, etc.)
* Add two new visualizations that enhance the article. We’ve expanded the original 538 dataset to offer additional variables to help you here. There should be a good reason you are adding each visualization to the article. You may need to create more than two to find interesting/useful visualizations. Hint for a successful choice: if you can find a place in the text to add “see figure” it’s probably a good start.

Here I learned:

# Lab2-JaveScript Overview
In this section, we will work on the html and javascript basics. Mainly, you need to understand HTML’s DOM (Document Object Model) structure, be able to select and edit DOM elements.

In this section, we will look at common ways to access and display information on your webpage.Display and modify dom elements Data: Variable, Object (also known as dictionary in python) and Array

In this section, we will write some for loops to manipulate our data. We will also take a look at custom sorting functions and present sorted results in a list.

In this section, we are going to create a <table> element. We are going to write functions to modify this table, and add a button to call this function. 

Selection (dropdown list), accessing form value, and sort by input
