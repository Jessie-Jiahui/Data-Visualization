# Lab1 Overview
It is a program to use data to validate an opinion "The Makeup Industry Is Now More Skin Shadeâ€“Inclusive Than Ever." I chose 
the data of historical shades set evolution of Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, for both its largest color variations in current mainstream foundations and its constant name convention (otherwise, I am not able to scrape its previous color set on the webpage). 

In this project, I:
* Researched and gathered information about a foundation which is able to has constant name convention and release information
* Scrape data from Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation's website for information about the shades such as its name, hex-code etc.
* Used an open-source color API to transfer each of the hex-code into its HSL(hue, saturation, lightness) color mode.
* Used Plot.ly to visualize the shades information in years on the canvas according to users' requirements.

Here you can:
*  get a figure of all the shades information for the past five years.
*  plot all the shade colors in a figure you just indicate on a the interactive interface.
