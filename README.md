The repository includes a group of homeworks for my SI649: Data-Visualization course this winter semester.

## Lab1-Tableau Overview
This homework asked us to use Tableau to generate a series of visualizations for the article ‚ÄúThe Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood‚Äôs Exclusion of Women‚Äù https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ 

In this project, I:
* Used given dataset to replicate the three visualizations in the original article using Tableau
* Add two new visualizations that enhance the article. 

What I learned from this homework:
* Data clean and manipulation: import, sort, make calculated fields, create groups, etc.
* Organize sheet: differentiate measure and dimensions, create simple visualization and change chart type, adjust encodings, adjust aggregation methods (e.g. sum, average, count), sort axis, etc.
* Build dashboard and stories
* Action: create annotations on the chart, create data filters, link sheets together with actions, add analytics enhancements (e.g., constant line, regression), edit legend and filter by legend, etc.

Below are some sample visualizations you will get:

# Introduction to the Files
There are a total of 5 python files you need to run this program and do the things mentioned above. These files are:
*  `alternate_advanced_caching.py`
*  `main.py`
*  `final_proj.py.py`
*  `final_plot.py`
*  `esteelauder_doublewear_data.py`

Of those 5 files, `main.py` is the main file you should run to perform all the functions. All the other four files are all supporting files. The detail about how to interact with the program will be talked in the *Instructions* section.

There are also 2 JSON files that will be generated during you run the main file. These files are just used for caching purpose and will not affect running the main file in any way.

In this section, we will look at common ways to access and display information on your webpage.Display and modify dom elements Data: Variable, Object (also known as dictionary in python) and Array

In this section, we will write some for loops to manipulate our data. We will also take a look at custom sorting functions and present sorted results in a list.

In this section, we are going to create a <table> element. We are going to write functions to modify this table, and add a button to call this function. 

Selection (dropdown list), accessing form value, and sort by input
