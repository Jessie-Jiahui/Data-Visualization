# Lab1-Tableau Overview
This homework asked us to use Tableau to generate a series of visualizations for the article “The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women” https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ 

In this project, I:
* Used given dataset to replicate the three visualizations in the original article using Tableau
* Add two new visualizations that enhance the article. 

What I learned from this homework:
* Data clean and manipulation: import, sort, make calculated fields, create groups, etc.
* Organize sheet: differentiate measure and dimensions, create simple visualization and change chart type, adjust encodings, adjust aggregation methods (e.g. sum, average, count), sort axis, etc.
* Build dashboard and stories
* Action: create annotations on the chart, create data filters, link sheets together with actions, add analytics enhancements (e.g., constant line, regression), edit legend and filter by legend, etc.

# Introduction to the Files
There are a total of 5 python files you need to run this program and do the things mentioned above. These files are:
*  `lab1.twb`
*  `lab1_individual.twbx`
*  `The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women.pdf`

Of those 3 files, `lab1_individual.twbx` is the main file you should open through Tableau. 

My visualization works from this homework:
Other than the first image, I generated all the five visualizations within the pdf file.
