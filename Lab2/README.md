# Lab2-JaveScript Overview
For this homework, we worked on the html and javascript basics, to generate a interactive webpage to display data. We were given the xxx file, and the skeleton of xxxx.

In this project, I:
* Create headings and paragraphs through selecting and editing DOM elements and filling with the processed data;
* Present top 10 movies by revenue in a list;
* Count and display genres within the data and their counts;
* Create a randome number generator and add a button to diplay a random movie in a table format;
* Create data field dropdown and create a table to diaplay the user selected field in the sorted way.

What I learned from this homework:
* Understand HTMLâ€™s DOM (Document Object Model) structure, be able to select and edit DOM elements using data types - Variable, Object, and Array;
* Display manipulated data in various formats (list and table);
* Link data with Call-to-Actions to enable user-controlled webpage interaction;

My visualization works from this homework:
