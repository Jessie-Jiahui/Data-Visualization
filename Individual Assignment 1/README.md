# Individual Assignment 1-Tableau Overview
Our task is to design a visualization for a small data set to effectively communicate something interesting about the data and provide a rigorous rationale for my design choices. We are free to use any graphics or charting tool - including drafting it by hand.

Intro of dataset:
* After the World War II, antibiotics were considered as "wonder drugs", since they were easy remedy for what had been intractable ailments. To learn which drug worked most effectively for which bacterial infection, performance of the three most popular antibiotics on 16 bacteria were gathered. The values in `a1-burtin-long_grouped.csv` file represent the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), a measure of the effectiveness of the antibiotic, which represents the concentration of antibiotic required to prevent growth in vitro. The reaction of the bacteria to Gram staining is described by the covariate ‚Äúgram staining‚Äù. Bacteria that are stained dark blue or violet are Gram-positive. Otherwise, they are Gram-negative.

My visualization work:

In this project, I:
* Familiar myself with the dataset background;
* Played with the given dataset to deduce interesting findings through Tableau;
* Answered the following three questions:
  - What are the variables?
  - What are some communication goals?
  - Which variables are most important to those goals?
* Designed and polished graphs in Sketch.

What I learned from this homework:
* Understand and practice the overall data visualization thinking process
  - Categorize data types (quantitative, ordinal, and nominal) and think about their ideal channels/encodings
  - Define the most suitable marks (points, lines, bar, etc.) to represent the data
  - Design the final viewer
* Understand and practice data visualization's best practices learned from the course
  - Establish viewing order by knowing where my audience will look first, second.
  - Layer, layer, layer. Design for reading at different levels of detail.
  - Balance between higher data-ink ratios and data encodings clarity
  - Use perceptually uniform colormaps
